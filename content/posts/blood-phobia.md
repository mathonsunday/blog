I don't know when I developed my blood phobia. As a kid I already knew to tell nurses that getting my blood drawn made me light headed. One nurse insisted that "If I do it right you won't". I remember walking into the waiting room and fainting. 

But this story would not be interesting if I was just bothered by getting my blood drawn. Around two years ago I fainted on a subway platform while listening to a podcast and was taken to the hostipal to test for head injuries. I had not fainted since I had gotten my blood drawn as a kid.

I didn't want to go to the hospital again so I became more cautious. Meeting new people became difficult. My tactic was to let people know if a topic of conversation was off limits to me. If they didn't immediately change the subject then I physically left the conversation. There was no chill, easy going way to handle this while protecting my safety.

Where I Was When I Started 

As a kid I played Crash Bandicoot and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater with my dad and brother.
