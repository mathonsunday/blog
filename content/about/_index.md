I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Compass](https://www.compass.com/), building a great real estate search experience on iOS and Android.

I started my career as a full stack web developer at a startup called Bizo. One year after I started, Bizo was acquired by LinkedIn for $175 million. At the time it was the largest acquisition LinkedIn had ever made. I spent one year with the same team working on the LinkedIn Lead Accelerator (LLA.)

I built my first iOS app as a side project and loved it. At the time I was interested in self-tracking and found that mobile apps unlocked astounding capabilities in this area. I was amazing by the potential use cases for mobile apps and decided I wanted to switch to iOS development. I moved to the New York City office to join the newly formed Video team as an iOS developer. I spent three years on the Video team. During that time I was part of the launches for Oscar (a standalone video Q&A app), video sharing for all of LinkedIn and video Stories.
